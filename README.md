# Debris_simulation
##Simulation_1 : 
our solution try to avoid collision of our hotel with other debris that already exist in leo , our proposition consists of launching 5 satellites with our hotel (that will be attached to the ISS or any other station depending on availibility ) this 5 satellites try to detect debris (small to medium size) and change their trajectory if there is a probability of collision , this first simulation illustrates the 5 sattelites (satahead,satbehind,satright,satleft and one largsat) and illustrates it's trajectory and it's orbit around the earth
##simulaton_2: 
this simulation shows as how the satellites function , which means how they push the debris to change their orbit in order to avoid collision , for further details check the report to see the technical and calculus side .
